# Codebook for variables in meanTidyDataset
Below are the list of variables in the tidy dataset:
activity_description
tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The variables are categorized into two signals; the time domain signals (prefix ‘t’) which was captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz and the Fast Fourier Transform (prefix ‘f’). These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern of the 3-axial signals in the X, Y, and Z direction (denoted as ‘-X’, ‘ -Y’, or ‘-Z’). Below, I define the acynoms 

"activity_description" – indicates the activity name for the measurement.  

Below, I define the acronyms:
std – Standard deviation
Acc – acceleration
Mag – magnitude
Gyro – angular velocity

See the features_info.txt in the original dataset for a thorough description of each variable.
